                <p class="body-text">You will notice that there are several posts on the front page (below the slideshow box). Automatically the 4 most recent posts will be featured on the front page. If you want to add a post to announce something, you should do it this way to ensure the post will be on the front page. If you want to keep a post on the front page for a long time you should use the slideshow feature instead.</p>
                <p class="body-text minor-heading">Post header:</p>
                <p class="body-text">Posts have a slightly different header as can be seen below.</p>

                    title: 2018 Congress Documents and Journal Articles are Now Available<br>
                    layout: post<br>

                </p>
                <p class="body-text">The title section will become the title of the post. The picture section should be a link to a picture on the web server. This picture will be used on the fron page. You should not change any of the other fields.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The front page also contains an excerpt of the post. All text from the start of the article until the &#60;!--stop--> will be used as the excerpt. Hence you will need to put &#60;!--stop--> after the section of text you want to be excerpt. An example is given below.</p>
                <p class="code-line">Welcome to the new SERCI website! Take a few minutes to look around and familiarise yourself with the new look.

                <p class="body-text minor-heading">Post title:</p>
                <p class="body-text">The filename for posts is very important. The date must be the first thing in the filename followed by the actual filename. You should only use "-" as a seperator. An example of a filename is given below.</p>
                <p class="code-line">2018-17-10-this-will-be-the-post-filename.md</p>
                <p class="body-text">Jekyll will read this filename and create an html file called "this-will-be-the-post-filename.html".</p>

                <p class="tutorial-subtitle-text">Changing the slideshow</p>
                <p class="body-text">You can control the slideshow on the front page by changing the slideshow_data.txt file. Each line of that document reprisents a slide in the slideshow. There should always be exactly 3 slides, hence, <b>there should always be exactly 3 lines in the file</b>. If you insert and extra blank line anywhere in the file (even at the end) this will be interpreted as 4th slide and it will break the slide show.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Each line has 3 fields, the slide title, a link to the slide picture and link to where users will be taken to when they click on the slide. These 3 fields are seperated by the "~" character. There must always be these 3 fields and they must always be in the order mentioned. An example is shown below. Note that there are no spaces between the fields, only the "~" character.</p>
